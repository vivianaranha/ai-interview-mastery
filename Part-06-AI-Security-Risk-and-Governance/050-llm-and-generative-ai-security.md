## Question 1

**Q: What does tokenization mean in the context of LLM & Generative AI Security, and why is it important?**

**Answer:** Tokenization is converting raw text into the discrete token IDs a language model consumes. In LLM & Generative AI Security, its importance comes from turning broad principles into repeatable decisions and evidence. I would define the risk or obligation being managed, the accountable owner, the required control, and the proof that the control operates. Good governance should be proportional to impact: low-risk experimentation should not face the same burden as a system making consequential decisions.

---

## Question 2

**Q: How would you assess the risk associated with tokenization before approving an AI use case?**

**Answer:** I would assess tokenization using impact, likelihood, affected stakeholders, data sensitivity, autonomy, reversibility, scale, and regulatory exposure. I would distinguish inherent risk from residual risk after controls. The result should determine the review depth, testing, approval authority, monitoring, and human oversight required. I would document assumptions because a change in data, users, geography, or use can move the system into a different risk category.

---

## Question 3

**Q: What policy or control requirements would you define around tokenization?**

**Answer:** Controls around tokenization should state what is required, who owns it, when it applies, and what evidence proves compliance. I would prefer controls that are testable and automatable where possible—for example policy checks, access rules, evaluation gates, logging, or approval workflows. The control should reduce a specific risk rather than exist as paperwork. Exceptions should be explicit, approved, time-bounded, and supported by compensating controls.

---

## Question 4

**Q: Who should own decisions about tokenization, and how should responsibilities be divided?**

**Answer:** Ownership for tokenization should follow clear decision rights. The business owner is accountable for the use case and outcome; technical owners are responsible for design and operation; security, privacy, legal, risk, or model-validation teams provide independent challenge where appropriate. A governance body should resolve cross-functional issues, but it should not become the default owner of every decision. RACI-style clarity is useful when accountability would otherwise be ambiguous.

---

## Question 5

**Q: What documentation and evidence would you require to demonstrate effective management of tokenization?**

**Answer:** For tokenization, I would require evidence proportional to risk: purpose and scope, data sources, architecture, model or vendor information, evaluations, known limitations, threat or impact assessments, approvals, change history, monitoring results, and incident records. Evidence should be reproducible and linked to the actual deployed version. The goal is that an independent reviewer can understand what the system does, why it was approved, and whether controls are operating.

---

## Question 6

**Q: How would you measure whether governance around tokenization is actually effective rather than just documented?**

**Answer:** I would measure governance effectiveness through outcomes, not document counts. Useful indicators include percentage of use cases inventoried, time through review, control pass rates, unresolved high-risk findings, exceptions past due, incidents, drift in risk classification, monitoring coverage, and remediation closure time. I would also watch for perverse incentives: if teams avoid registering use cases because governance is too slow, the process is failing even if the dashboard looks clean.

---

## Question 7

**Q: How should exceptions involving tokenization be reviewed, approved, and time-bounded?**

**Answer:** An exception involving tokenization should include a precise policy deviation, business rationale, risk assessment, compensating controls, named owner, approving authority, expiration date, and conditions for renewal. Exceptions should be visible and periodically reviewed. They should never silently become permanent policy. Repeated exceptions are also a signal that either the standard is unrealistic or the underlying capability needs investment.

---

## Question 8

**Q: How would you govern tokenization across development, validation, deployment, monitoring, change, and retirement?**

**Answer:** I would govern tokenization across the full lifecycle: intake and classification, design requirements, data and model review, testing, approval, controlled deployment, monitoring, material-change review, incident handling, and retirement. Controls should follow the deployed artifact and its version. A system that was safe at approval can become unsafe after data, model, integration, user, or policy changes, so governance must include change triggers and ongoing monitoring.

---

## Question 9

**Q: A business team argues that controls around tokenization will slow innovation. How would you respond?**

**Answer:** I would acknowledge that poor governance can slow delivery, but unmanaged risk can stop delivery entirely after an incident. The answer is risk-tiered governance: automate low-risk checks, reuse approved components, define fast paths for common patterns, and reserve intensive review for higher-impact cases. For tokenization, I would ask which control is causing friction, what risk it mitigates, and whether the same risk can be reduced with a faster or more automated mechanism.

---

## Question 10

**Q: How would you communicate the material risks and required decisions around tokenization to senior leadership?**

**Answer:** For senior leadership, I would communicate tokenization in four parts: the business objective, the material risk, the current control posture, and the decision or investment required. I would avoid overwhelming executives with model-level detail unless it changes the decision. I would show trend, exposure, and residual risk, including what could happen if no action is taken. The goal is informed risk ownership, not a technical status report.

---

## Question 11

**Q: What does context windows mean in the context of LLM & Generative AI Security, and why is it important?**

**Answer:** Context windows is the finite amount of input and generated content a model can consider in a single inference request. In LLM & Generative AI Security, its importance comes from turning broad principles into repeatable decisions and evidence. I would define the risk or obligation being managed, the accountable owner, the required control, and the proof that the control operates.

A governance body should resolve cross-functional issues, but it should not become the default owner of every decision. RACI-style clarity is useful when accountability would otherwise be ambiguous.

---

## Question 65

**Q: What documentation and evidence would you require to demonstrate effective management of quantization?**

**Answer:** For quantization, I would require evidence proportional to risk: purpose and scope, data sources, architecture, model or vendor information, evaluations, known limitations, threat or impact assessments, approvals, change history, monitoring results, and incident records. Evidence should be reproducible and linked to the actual deployed version. The goal is that an independent reviewer can understand what the system does, why it was approved, and whether controls are operating.

---

## Question 66

**Q: How would you measure whether governance around quantization is actually effective rather than just documented?**

**Answer:** I would measure governance effectiveness through outcomes, not document counts. Useful indicators include percentage of use cases inventoried, time through review, control pass rates, unresolved high-risk findings, exceptions past due, incidents, drift in risk classification, monitoring coverage, and remediation closure time. I would also watch for perverse incentives: if teams avoid registering use cases because governance is too slow, the process is failing even if the dashboard looks clean.

---

## Question 67

**Q: How should exceptions involving quantization be reviewed, approved, and time-bounded?**

**Answer:** An exception involving quantization should include a precise policy deviation, business rationale, risk assessment, compensating controls, named owner, approving authority, expiration date, and conditions for renewal. Exceptions should be visible and periodically reviewed. They should never silently become permanent policy. Repeated exceptions are also a signal that either the standard is unrealistic or the underlying capability needs investment.

---

## Question 68

**Q: How would you govern quantization across development, validation, deployment, monitoring, change, and retirement?**

**Answer:** I would govern quantization across the full lifecycle: intake and classification, design requirements, data and model review, testing, approval, controlled deployment, monitoring, material-change review, incident handling, and retirement. Controls should follow the deployed artifact and its version. A system that was safe at approval can become unsafe after data, model, integration, user, or policy changes, so governance must include change triggers and ongoing monitoring.

---

## Question 69

**Q: A business team argues that controls around quantization will slow innovation. How would you respond?**

**Answer:** I would acknowledge that poor governance can slow delivery, but unmanaged risk can stop delivery entirely after an incident. The answer is risk-tiered governance: automate low-risk checks, reuse approved components, define fast paths for common patterns, and reserve intensive review for higher-impact cases. For quantization, I would ask which control is causing friction, what risk it mitigates, and whether the same risk can be reduced with a faster or more automated mechanism.

---

## Question 70

**Q: How would you communicate the material risks and required decisions around quantization to senior leadership?**

**Answer:** For senior leadership, I would communicate quantization in four parts: the business objective, the material risk, the current control posture, and the decision or investment required. I would avoid overwhelming executives with model-level detail unless it changes the decision. I would show trend, exposure, and residual risk, including what could happen if no action is taken. The goal is informed risk ownership, not a technical status report.

---

## Question 71

**Q: What does hallucination mean in the context of LLM & Generative AI Security, and why is it important?**

**Answer:** Hallucination is model output that is unsupported, incorrect, or fabricated despite being presented as plausible. In LLM & Generative AI Security, its importance comes from turning broad principles into repeatable decisions and evidence. I would define the risk or obligation being managed, the accountable owner, the required control, and the proof that the control operates. Good governance should be proportional to impact: low-risk experimentation should not face the same burden as a system making consequential decisions.

---

## Question 72

**Q: How would you assess the risk associated with hallucination before approving an AI use case?**

**Answer:** I would assess hallucination using impact, likelihood, affected stakeholders, data sensitivity, autonomy, reversibility, scale, and regulatory exposure. I would distinguish inherent risk from residual risk after controls. The result should determine the review depth, testing, approval authority, monitoring, and human oversight required. I would document assumptions because a change in data, users, geography, or use can move the system into a different risk category.

---

## Question 73

**Q: What policy or control requirements would you define around hallucination?**

**Answer:** Controls around hallucination should state what is required, who owns it, when it applies, and what evidence proves compliance. I would prefer controls that are testable and automatable where possible—for example policy checks, access rules, evaluation gates, logging, or approval workflows. The control should reduce a specific risk rather than exist as paperwork. Exceptions should be explicit, approved, time-bounded, and supported by compensating controls.

---

## Question 74

**Q: Who should own decisions about hallucination, and how should responsibilities be divided?**

**Answer:** Ownership for hallucination should follow clear decision rights. The business owner is accountable for the use case and outcome; technical owners are responsible for design and operation; security, privacy, legal, risk, or model-validation teams provide independent challenge where appropriate. A governance body should resolve cross-functional issues, but it should not become the default owner of every decision. RACI-style clarity is useful when accountability would otherwise be ambiguous.

## Question 81

**Q: What does tool use mean in the context of LLM & Generative AI Security, and why is it important?**

**Answer:** Tool use is allowing a model or agent to invoke external functions or services to retrieve information or perform controlled actions. In LLM & Generative AI Security, its importance comes from turning broad principles into repeatable decisions and evidence. I would define the risk or obligation being managed, the accountable owner, the required control, and the proof that the control operates. Good governance should be proportional to impact: low-risk experimentation should not face the same burden as a system making consequential decisions.
