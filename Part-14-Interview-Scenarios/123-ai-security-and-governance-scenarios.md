# Section 123: AI Security & Governance Scenarios

> **110 interview questions and answers** covering AI Security & Governance Scenarios.

These answers are designed as concise interview-ready frameworks. Adapt them with your own examples, architecture choices, metrics, industry constraints, and company context rather than memorizing them word-for-word.

---

## Question 1

**Q: In a scenario involving threat modeling, what questions would you ask first to clarify requirements, users, constraints, and success criteria?**

**Answer:** I would begin by clarifying the scenario before designing anything. For threat modeling, I would ask who the users are, what decision or workflow is being improved, current volume and baseline performance, required accuracy or quality, latency expectations, data sources, integrations, security constraints, failure consequences, and the measurable definition of success. I would state assumptions explicitly when information is missing. Good system design interviews reward disciplined scoping as much as architecture.

---

## Question 2

**Q: How would you structure the architecture or solution approach when threat modeling is a central requirement?**

**Answer:** I would structure the solution around clear boundaries: user or upstream system, API or workflow layer, domain logic, data/retrieval layer, model or decision component, integrations, persistence, and observability. Threat modeling would be placed where it directly supports a requirement rather than spread across the design. I would show data flow, trust boundaries, synchronous versus asynchronous paths, and fallback behavior. I would also identify which components can stay deterministic.

---

## Question 3

**Q: What data would you need for threat modeling, and how would you assess its quality, access, ownership, and freshness?**

**Answer:** For threat modeling, I would inventory the data needed, its system of record, ownership, volume, schema, sensitivity, freshness, quality, labeling, and access pattern. I would separate training or evaluation data from live operational data. Before relying on it, I would test completeness, representativeness, leakage, duplication, stale values, and permission boundaries. If data is not fit for purpose, the architecture should expose that limitation rather than hide it behind a model.

---

## Question 4

**Q: How would you choose the model, algorithm, workflow, or non-AI alternative for threat modeling?**

**Answer:** I would choose the simplest approach to threat modeling that meets the requirements. I would compare deterministic logic, classical ML, retrieval, generative models, agents, or human review based on task structure, available data, uncertainty, latency, explainability, safety, and cost. A more capable model is not automatically a better system. I would keep high-risk actions deterministic or approval-gated when model uncertainty is unacceptable.

---

## Question 5

**Q: What security, privacy, governance, or compliance risks would you address before implementing threat modeling?**

**Answer:** I would threat-model the scenario around threat modeling: sensitive data, identities, external inputs, tools, model endpoints, secrets, tenant boundaries, and consequential actions. Controls would include strong authentication, least privilege, authorization at the data and action layers, validation, encryption, audit logging, and isolation. For generative or agentic components, I would assume prompt injection and incorrect outputs are normal failure modes and design containment accordingly.

---

## Question 6

**Q: What failure modes would you design for when threat modeling is part of a business-critical workflow?**

**Answer:** I would enumerate failures around threat modeling before launch: malformed input, stale or missing data, model timeout, low-confidence output, tool failure, dependency outage, partial transaction, duplicate request, and incorrect or unsafe response. Each critical failure should map to retry, timeout, fallback, compensation, human escalation, or graceful degradation. I would define which failures are safe to automate through and which must stop the workflow.

---

## Question 7

**Q: How would you scale a solution involving threat modeling while controlling latency, throughput, and operational complexity?**

**Answer:** To scale threat modeling, I would estimate average and peak request volume, concurrency, payload or context size, model latency, storage growth, and downstream limits. I would use caching, batching, asynchronous work, queues, autoscaling, sharding, or model routing where the workload justifies them. I would measure tail latency and saturation under load. Capacity plans should include failure conditions, not only normal traffic.

---

## Question 8

**Q: What would you log, trace, monitor, and alert on for threat modeling?**

**Answer:** I would instrument threat modeling with request IDs, structured logs, distributed traces, service metrics, dependency metrics, model or retrieval telemetry, quality signals, token or compute use, and business outcome metrics. Alerts should correspond to actionable conditions such as error spikes, latency SLO breaches, quality regression, unexpected tool actions, or cost anomalies. I would design dashboards around user journeys rather than isolated services.

---

## Question 9

**Q: How would you estimate the cost, value, and ROI of the proposed approach to threat modeling?**

**Answer:** For threat modeling, I would estimate total cost across engineering, data preparation, model or API usage, infrastructure, integration, security, operations, and human review. Then I would compare it with a baseline business outcome such as hours saved, errors avoided, revenue gained, or risk reduced. I would express value per successful task or workflow where possible. The design should include cost controls before scale, not after the invoice arrives.

---

## Question 10

**Q: How would you present your recommendation about threat modeling, including assumptions, trade-offs, risks, and next steps, to stakeholders?**

**Answer:** I would present the recommendation as a decision narrative: problem and success criteria, assumptions, proposed architecture, why threat modeling is handled this way, alternatives considered, major trade-offs, risks and mitigations, expected cost and value, and what I would validate first. I would distinguish facts from assumptions. If time is limited, I would focus on the decisions that materially affect correctness, safety, scalability, or business outcome.

---

## Question 11

**Q: In a scenario involving prompt injection, what questions would you ask first to clarify requirements, users, constraints, and success criteria?**

**Answer:** I would begin by clarifying the scenario before designing anything. For prompt injection, I would ask who the users are, what decision or workflow is being improved, current volume and baseline performance, required accuracy or quality, latency expectations, data sources, integrations, security constraints, failure consequences, and the measurable definition of success.

If data is not fit for purpose, the architecture should expose that limitation rather than hide it behind a model.

---

## Question 64

**Q: How would you choose the model, algorithm, workflow, or non-AI alternative for sandboxing?**

**Answer:** I would choose the simplest approach to sandboxing that meets the requirements. I would compare deterministic logic, classical ML, retrieval, generative models, agents, or human review based on task structure, available data, uncertainty, latency, explainability, safety, and cost. A more capable model is not automatically a better system. I would keep high-risk actions deterministic or approval-gated when model uncertainty is unacceptable.

---

## Question 65

**Q: What security, privacy, governance, or compliance risks would you address before implementing sandboxing?**

**Answer:** I would threat-model the scenario around sandboxing: sensitive data, identities, external inputs, tools, model endpoints, secrets, tenant boundaries, and consequential actions. Controls would include strong authentication, least privilege, authorization at the data and action layers, validation, encryption, audit logging, and isolation. For generative or agentic components, I would assume prompt injection and incorrect outputs are normal failure modes and design containment accordingly.

---

## Question 66

**Q: What failure modes would you design for when sandboxing is part of a business-critical workflow?**

**Answer:** I would enumerate failures around sandboxing before launch: malformed input, stale or missing data, model timeout, low-confidence output, tool failure, dependency outage, partial transaction, duplicate request, and incorrect or unsafe response. Each critical failure should map to retry, timeout, fallback, compensation, human escalation, or graceful degradation. I would define which failures are safe to automate through and which must stop the workflow.

---

## Question 67

**Q: How would you scale a solution involving sandboxing while controlling latency, throughput, and operational complexity?**

**Answer:** To scale sandboxing, I would estimate average and peak request volume, concurrency, payload or context size, model latency, storage growth, and downstream limits. I would use caching, batching, asynchronous work, queues, autoscaling, sharding, or model routing where the workload justifies them. I would measure tail latency and saturation under load. Capacity plans should include failure conditions, not only normal traffic.

---

## Question 68

**Q: What would you log, trace, monitor, and alert on for sandboxing?**

**Answer:** I would instrument sandboxing with request IDs, structured logs, distributed traces, service metrics, dependency metrics, model or retrieval telemetry, quality signals, token or compute use, and business outcome metrics. Alerts should correspond to actionable conditions such as error spikes, latency SLO breaches, quality regression, unexpected tool actions, or cost anomalies. I would design dashboards around user journeys rather than isolated services.

---

## Question 69

**Q: How would you estimate the cost, value, and ROI of the proposed approach to sandboxing?**

**Answer:** For sandboxing, I would estimate total cost across engineering, data preparation, model or API usage, infrastructure, integration, security, operations, and human review. Then I would compare it with a baseline business outcome such as hours saved, errors avoided, revenue gained, or risk reduced. I would express value per successful task or workflow where possible. The design should include cost controls before scale, not after the invoice arrives.

---

## Question 70

**Q: How would you present your recommendation about sandboxing, including assumptions, trade-offs, risks, and next steps, to stakeholders?**

**Answer:** I would present the recommendation as a decision narrative: problem and success criteria, assumptions, proposed architecture, why sandboxing is handled this way, alternatives considered, major trade-offs, risks and mitigations, expected cost and value, and what I would validate first. I would distinguish facts from assumptions. If time is limited, I would focus on the decisions that materially affect correctness, safety, scalability, or business outcome.

---

## Question 71

**Q: In a scenario involving supply-chain risk, what questions would you ask first to clarify requirements, users, constraints, and success criteria?**

**Answer:** I would begin by clarifying the scenario before designing anything. For supply-chain risk, I would ask who the users are, what decision or workflow is being improved, current volume and baseline performance, required accuracy or quality, latency expectations, data sources, integrations, security constraints, failure consequences, and the measurable definition of success. I would state assumptions explicitly when information is missing. Good system design interviews reward disciplined scoping as much as architecture.

---

## Question 72

**Q: How would you structure the architecture or solution approach when supply-chain risk is a central requirement?**

**Answer:** I would structure the solution around clear boundaries: user or upstream system, API or workflow layer, domain logic, data/retrieval layer, model or decision component, integrations, persistence, and observability. Supply-chain risk would be placed where it directly supports a requirement rather than spread across the design. I would show data flow, trust boundaries, synchronous versus asynchronous paths, and fallback behavior. I would also identify which components can stay deterministic.

---

## Question 73

**Q: What data would you need for supply-chain risk, and how would you assess its quality, access, ownership, and freshness?**

**Answer:** For supply-chain risk, I would inventory the data needed, its system of record, ownership, volume, schema, sensitivity, freshness, quality, labeling, and access pattern. I would separate training or evaluation data from live operational data. Before relying on it, I would test completeness, representativeness, leakage, duplication, stale values, and permission boundaries. If data is not fit for purpose, the architecture should expose that limitation rather than hide it behind a model.
