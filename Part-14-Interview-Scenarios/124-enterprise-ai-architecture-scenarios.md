# Section 124: Enterprise AI Architecture Scenarios

> **110 interview questions and answers** covering Enterprise AI Architecture Scenarios.

These answers are designed as concise interview-ready frameworks. Adapt them with your own examples, architecture choices, metrics, industry constraints, and company context rather than memorizing them word-for-word.

---

## Question 1

**Q: In a scenario involving requirements, what questions would you ask first to clarify requirements, users, constraints, and success criteria?**

**Answer:** I would begin by clarifying the scenario before designing anything. For requirements, I would ask who the users are, what decision or workflow is being improved, current volume and baseline performance, required accuracy or quality, latency expectations, data sources, integrations, security constraints, failure consequences, and the measurable definition of success. I would state assumptions explicitly when information is missing. Good system design interviews reward disciplined scoping as much as architecture.

---

## Question 2

**Q: How would you structure the architecture or solution approach when requirements is a central requirement?**

**Answer:** I would structure the solution around clear boundaries: user or upstream system, API or workflow layer, domain logic, data/retrieval layer, model or decision component, integrations, persistence, and observability. Requirements would be placed where it directly supports a requirement rather than spread across the design. I would show data flow, trust boundaries, synchronous versus asynchronous paths, and fallback behavior. I would also identify which components can stay deterministic.

---

## Question 3

**Q: What data would you need for requirements, and how would you assess its quality, access, ownership, and freshness?**

**Answer:** For requirements, I would inventory the data needed, its system of record, ownership, volume, schema, sensitivity, freshness, quality, labeling, and access pattern. I would separate training or evaluation data from live operational data. Before relying on it, I would test completeness, representativeness, leakage, duplication, stale values, and permission boundaries. If data is not fit for purpose, the architecture should expose that limitation rather than hide it behind a model.

---

## Question 4

**Q: How would you choose the model, algorithm, workflow, or non-AI alternative for requirements?**

**Answer:** I would choose the simplest approach to requirements that meets the requirements. I would compare deterministic logic, classical ML, retrieval, generative models, agents, or human review based on task structure, available data, uncertainty, latency, explainability, safety, and cost. A more capable model is not automatically a better system. I would keep high-risk actions deterministic or approval-gated when model uncertainty is unacceptable.

---

## Question 5

**Q: What security, privacy, governance, or compliance risks would you address before implementing requirements?**

**Answer:** I would threat-model the scenario around requirements: sensitive data, identities, external inputs, tools, model endpoints, secrets, tenant boundaries, and consequential actions. Controls would include strong authentication, least privilege, authorization at the data and action layers, validation, encryption, audit logging, and isolation. For generative or agentic components, I would assume prompt injection and incorrect outputs are normal failure modes and design containment accordingly.

---

## Question 6

**Q: What failure modes would you design for when requirements is part of a business-critical workflow?**

**Answer:** I would enumerate failures around requirements before launch: malformed input, stale or missing data, model timeout, low-confidence output, tool failure, dependency outage, partial transaction, duplicate request, and incorrect or unsafe response. Each critical failure should map to retry, timeout, fallback, compensation, human escalation, or graceful degradation. I would define which failures are safe to automate through and which must stop the workflow.

---

## Question 7

**Q: How would you scale a solution involving requirements while controlling latency, throughput, and operational complexity?**

**Answer:** To scale requirements, I would estimate average and peak request volume, concurrency, payload or context size, model latency, storage growth, and downstream limits. I would use caching, batching, asynchronous work, queues, autoscaling, sharding, or model routing where the workload justifies them. I would measure tail latency and saturation under load. Capacity plans should include failure conditions, not only normal traffic.

---

## Question 8

**Q: What would you log, trace, monitor, and alert on for requirements?**

**Answer:** I would instrument requirements with request IDs, structured logs, distributed traces, service metrics, dependency metrics, model or retrieval telemetry, quality signals, token or compute use, and business outcome metrics. Alerts should correspond to actionable conditions such as error spikes, latency SLO breaches, quality regression, unexpected tool actions, or cost anomalies. I would design dashboards around user journeys rather than isolated services.

---

## Question 9

**Q: How would you estimate the cost, value, and ROI of the proposed approach to requirements?**

**Answer:** For requirements, I would estimate total cost across engineering, data preparation, model or API usage, infrastructure, integration, security, operations, and human review. Then I would compare it with a baseline business outcome such as hours saved, errors avoided, revenue gained, or risk reduced. I would express value per successful task or workflow where possible. The design should include cost controls before scale, not after the invoice arrives.

---

## Question 10

**Q: How would you present your recommendation about requirements, including assumptions, trade-offs, risks, and next steps, to stakeholders?**

**Answer:** I would present the recommendation as a decision narrative: problem and success criteria, assumptions, proposed architecture, why requirements is handled this way, alternatives considered, major trade-offs, risks and mitigations, expected cost and value, and what I would validate first. I would distinguish facts from assumptions. If time is limited, I would focus on the decisions that materially affect correctness, safety, scalability, or business outcome.

---

## Question 11

**Q: In a scenario involving component boundaries, what questions would you ask first to clarify requirements, users, constraints, and success criteria?**

**Answer:** I would begin by clarifying the scenario before designing anything.

**Q: How would you choose the model, algorithm, workflow, or non-AI alternative for scalability?**

**Answer:** I would choose the simplest approach to scalability that meets the requirements. I would compare deterministic logic, classical ML, retrieval, generative models, agents, or human review based on task structure, available data, uncertainty, latency, explainability, safety, and cost. A more capable model is not automatically a better system. I would keep high-risk actions deterministic or approval-gated when model uncertainty is unacceptable.

---

## Question 65

**Q: What security, privacy, governance, or compliance risks would you address before implementing scalability?**

**Answer:** I would threat-model the scenario around scalability: sensitive data, identities, external inputs, tools, model endpoints, secrets, tenant boundaries, and consequential actions. Controls would include strong authentication, least privilege, authorization at the data and action layers, validation, encryption, audit logging, and isolation. For generative or agentic components, I would assume prompt injection and incorrect outputs are normal failure modes and design containment accordingly.

---

## Question 66

**Q: What failure modes would you design for when scalability is part of a business-critical workflow?**

**Answer:** I would enumerate failures around scalability before launch: malformed input, stale or missing data, model timeout, low-confidence output, tool failure, dependency outage, partial transaction, duplicate request, and incorrect or unsafe response. Each critical failure should map to retry, timeout, fallback, compensation, human escalation, or graceful degradation. I would define which failures are safe to automate through and which must stop the workflow.

---

## Question 67

**Q: How would you scale a solution involving scalability while controlling latency, throughput, and operational complexity?**

**Answer:** To scale scalability, I would estimate average and peak request volume, concurrency, payload or context size, model latency, storage growth, and downstream limits. I would use caching, batching, asynchronous work, queues, autoscaling, sharding, or model routing where the workload justifies them. I would measure tail latency and saturation under load. Capacity plans should include failure conditions, not only normal traffic.

---

## Question 68

**Q: What would you log, trace, monitor, and alert on for scalability?**

**Answer:** I would instrument scalability with request IDs, structured logs, distributed traces, service metrics, dependency metrics, model or retrieval telemetry, quality signals, token or compute use, and business outcome metrics. Alerts should correspond to actionable conditions such as error spikes, latency SLO breaches, quality regression, unexpected tool actions, or cost anomalies. I would design dashboards around user journeys rather than isolated services.

---

## Question 69

**Q: How would you estimate the cost, value, and ROI of the proposed approach to scalability?**

**Answer:** For scalability, I would estimate total cost across engineering, data preparation, model or API usage, infrastructure, integration, security, operations, and human review. Then I would compare it with a baseline business outcome such as hours saved, errors avoided, revenue gained, or risk reduced. I would express value per successful task or workflow where possible. The design should include cost controls before scale, not after the invoice arrives.

---

## Question 70

**Q: How would you present your recommendation about scalability, including assumptions, trade-offs, risks, and next steps, to stakeholders?**

**Answer:** I would present the recommendation as a decision narrative: problem and success criteria, assumptions, proposed architecture, why scalability is handled this way, alternatives considered, major trade-offs, risks and mitigations, expected cost and value, and what I would validate first. I would distinguish facts from assumptions. If time is limited, I would focus on the decisions that materially affect correctness, safety, scalability, or business outcome.

---

## Question 71

**Q: In a scenario involving deployment topology, what questions would you ask first to clarify requirements, users, constraints, and success criteria?**

**Answer:** I would begin by clarifying the scenario before designing anything. For deployment topology, I would ask who the users are, what decision or workflow is being improved, current volume and baseline performance, required accuracy or quality, latency expectations, data sources, integrations, security constraints, failure consequences, and the measurable definition of success. I would state assumptions explicitly when information is missing. Good system design interviews reward disciplined scoping as much as architecture.

---

## Question 72

**Q: How would you structure the architecture or solution approach when deployment topology is a central requirement?**

**Answer:** I would structure the solution around clear boundaries: user or upstream system, API or workflow layer, domain logic, data/retrieval layer, model or decision component, integrations, persistence, and observability. Deployment topology would be placed where it directly supports a requirement rather than spread across the design. I would show data flow, trust boundaries, synchronous versus asynchronous paths, and fallback behavior. I would also identify which components can stay deterministic.

---

## Question 73

**Q: What data would you need for deployment topology, and how would you assess its quality, access, ownership, and freshness?**

**Answer:** For deployment topology, I would inventory the data needed, its system of record, ownership, volume, schema, sensitivity, freshness, quality, labeling, and access pattern. I would separate training or evaluation data from live operational data. Before relying on it, I would test completeness, representativeness, leakage, duplication, stale values, and permission boundaries. If data is not fit for purpose, the architecture should expose that limitation rather than hide it behind a model.

---

## Question 74

**Q: How would you choose the model, algorithm, workflow, or non-AI alternative for deployment topology?**

**Answer:** I would choose the simplest approach to deployment topology that meets the requirements.
